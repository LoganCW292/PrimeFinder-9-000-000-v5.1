# PrimeFinder-9-000-000-v5.1
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a "light-weight" executable that creates a list of prime numbers until either the program crashes,
or the system runs out of memory.

They're currently two versions being worked on, the multi-threaded and the single-threaded.
in the future I want to create benchmarks based on information the program creates.
as well as generate a score on what it thinks the proccessor is earned.
